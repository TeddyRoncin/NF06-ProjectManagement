This files defines some terms used in the project.

- DEPTH : When going through the tree, we gain a unit of depth when we are entering an intersection, and lose one when
          we are leaving it.

- BEGINNING TASK : The first task of the project. It cannot be removed. It cannot really be viewed as a task in the
                   usual sense. It is used to represent when the project starts.

- PROJECT TASK : The last task of the project. It cannot be removed. It represents the task that requires the project to
                 be over.

- UPSTREAM TASK : It represents a task that needs to be entirely completed before the other task can begin. In the
                  larger definition, it is a task that needs to be completed before the other task can begin, but there
                  may be other tasks between the two. For example, if we have a task B that needs to be completed before
                  a task C, and a task A that needs to be completed before task B, then task task C accepts task B as an
                  upstream task, but also accepts task A in the larger definition.

- DOWNSTREAM TASK : Same definition as upstream task, but reversed. It is a task that can only begin after the other
                    task is completed.

- LINE : A line is a list of Tasks that are all connected to each other, without any branching of other tasks. The tasks
         are all dependent to the previous, and no other one.

- BRANCH : A branch is a list of Tasks that are at least at the same level of depth as the first task of the branch.

- INTERSECTION : A set of branches where the first task of each branch share the same upstream task, and the last task
                 of each branch share the same downstream task.

- BOUNDING BOX : A rectangle (represented using the class pygame.Rect) representing an area. It is mostly used to
                 represent where to draw a widget on the screen.
